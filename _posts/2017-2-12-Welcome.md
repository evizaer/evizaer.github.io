I'll be posting relatively short game design and programming articles in this space over the coming weeks.

If you want to get a taste of my earlier writing, you can check out my old MMO blog, [That's a terrible idea](http://thatsaterribleidea.com).I also have some creative writing and general short stuff up at a largely defunct tumblr called [A False Defection](http://falsedefection.tumblr.com/).

Many article ideas have been developed in response to discussions on the [Dinofarm discord server](https://discord.gg/Zqt2RAX), which is a nice community of strategy game enthusiasts and designers. We'd love to have you join us if you're interested in strategy games.
