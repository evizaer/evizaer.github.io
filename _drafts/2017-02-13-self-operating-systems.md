VIctoria II is a fascinating grand strategy game. 

* Complex system of interacting bits that you only have indirect control over.
* Self-operating. Interesting things happen without you.

Most games require the player to act for the game state to move forward in any recognizable way.

WIth self-operation we must sacrifice a few comfortable game design concepts.

* It's hard to define victory in a system where you arrive in medias res and there is no natural stoipping point. But is there necessarily no natural stopping point?

## Organic Difficulty with Excitement
Difficulty selection is the more organic process of choosing which country you'll play in Victoria II instead of choosing between "Easy" and "Hard" directly. This is a fascinating kind of non-linear conception of difficulty in a strategy game. By playing more you learn more about the kinds of difficulty that different countries offer. Playing as a weaker nation in a grand strategy game is far more exciting than going from "normal" to "hard". You've seen that nation lose and suffer and struggle, and now you get to show your knowledge and skill by making it into a power house. Humble beginnings make the reward of expansion and security ever sweeter.
