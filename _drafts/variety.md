Variety is all about how people perceive change.

Change in human perception is relative. A continuous change in a variable becomes boring and predictable. What attracts us are then changes in change--a sudden spike or flattening-out.

People are pretty good at linear extrapolation and pretty bad at exponential growth. Linear changes are thus more boring than exponential-like changes.

Variety is about contrast. Systems that exhibit strong variety allow many interactions that interact with different dimensions of game pieces. @insert (Use lowering of HP as blandness example here.)

Players will find games with strong analogy and variety interesting independent of agency. Spectator sports are a big business for the same reason that analogy and variety together succeed without agency. Of the three, the player likely needs high levels of agency the least. But that's a topic for my @InsertLink post on agency.
