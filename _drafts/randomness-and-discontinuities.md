What is discontinuity?

# from a DFF post.

Consider the hit-miss + random damage style of combat resolution. The generally negative results of this kind of design could be attributed to it being multi-layered randomness that mixes qualitative and quantitative (EDIT: without player intervention allowed in between). When mixing the kinds, perhaps too much variance tends to be introduced and that more aggressively gets in the way of player's decisions mattering.

But I think there's a further distinction to make here: quantitative results can have continuous or discontinuous effects. By this I mean the difference between killing something and just lowering its HP in a game where HP has no other effect. The valuation function for the outcomes of this randomness have an enormous discontinuity at the point which damage = remaining HP. This big, immediate jump in value seems far worse than a random damage result that changes the mean time till killing an enemy from 3 turns to 4. The distance between the randomness changing the game state and the discontinuous change in game state value is the crucial element. You want the randomness to feed into several turns of decision-making, in which its effects can be mitigated, instead of making the big jump in board value suddenly and wholly because of a randomly generated number. The big jump definitely requires a reaction from the player, but only after the fact since it's over so quickly (perhaps without any reaction possible before the big jump); the agency the player has in the result is way lower.
