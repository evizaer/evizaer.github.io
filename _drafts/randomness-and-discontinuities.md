There is one key concept you need to master in order to gain a significantly better understanding of how to effectively use randomness to achieve variety in game design at minimal cost to agency. You need to analyze the effects of randomness through identifying discontinuous results.

What is discontinuity?

Consider hit points in a typical Dungeons and Dragons-like combat system: The specific number of HP a character has doesn't matter much to the game's rules (@Comment strategic evaluation of players?) unless it crosses a certain critical threshold: 0. At that point the rules intervene in a profound way by severely curtailing the player's choices with that character. Yes, this is a weird way of putting "the character dies", but I want you to be thinking about the peculiar way in games that a number, usuaally representing some resource, doesn't mean much until it crosses a threshold, then it means *everything*.

I call this a discontinuity. It's a point at which a small, incremental change in the amount of a resource causes an outsized effect after otherwise not meaning much.

But I think there's a further distinction to make here: quantitative results can have continuous or discontinuous effects. By this I mean the difference between killing something and just lowering its HP in a game where HP has no other effect. The valuation function for the outcomes of this randomness have an enormous discontinuity at the point which damage = remaining HP. This big, immediate jump in value seems far worse than a random damage result that changes the mean time till killing an enemy from 3 turns to 4. The distance between the randomness changing the game state and the discontinuous change in game state value is the crucial element. You want the randomness to feed into several turns of decision-making, in which its effects can be mitigated, instead of making the big jump in board value suddenly and wholly because of a randomly generated number. The big jump definitely requires a reaction from the player, but only after the fact since it's over so quickly (perhaps without any reaction possible before the big jump); the agency the player has in the result is way lower.
