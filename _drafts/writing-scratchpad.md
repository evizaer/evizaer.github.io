# Grammar and sentence structure

Group words based on coherent units that play a role in the sentence. For instance, "The red-haired boy slowly walked to the store." There are three roles in this sentence: someone doing something, what they're doing, and a detail about what they're doing. Three units: "The red-haired boy", "slowly walked" and "to the store". This is one clause, since it expresses a grammatically whole thought, with a subject and a verb (and, in this case, an additional prepositional phrase to add flavor to the verb.)

Now build a more complex sentence: "The red-haired boy who walked slowly to the store yesterday can today be a red-haired millionaire." Now we've embedded the last sentence's semantic content into the subject role--"The red-haired boy who walked slowly to the store yesterday". 

## Information locality
People only have so much memory. You should put verbs close to the meatiest part of the nouns they apply to.
