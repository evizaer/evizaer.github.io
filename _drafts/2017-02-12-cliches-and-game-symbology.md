## Cliches and Game Symbology

“Why should this matter to me?” is a question seldom asked directly by someone who is viewing art, but lies at the root of the value of art. If a piece has no relevance to the observer--if the observer can gain no traction between his experience and content of the artwork--complaints and dismissal will likely follow. The relationship between art and observer is often, but need not be built of life experience outside of art. (Art can be self-referential, or largely valuable because of its relationship to other art.) Without understanding these relationships between symbols in art and their personal experience, the observer finds difficulty appreciating the art. Games have similar representational problems to solve, but they not only aim to produce a given kind of interpretation, they also test the player’s interpretation against the system itself. If the player cannot pass this test, the game prevents the player from progressing to other parts of the work. The twinning of testing the player’s skill and wishing for the player to progress through some significant part of the game requires games to hew closer to symbols and representations that players can interpret without particularly hard work or specialist knowledge. The fastest way to quickly symbolize certain kinds of game bits and relationships between game bits involves using a framework of cliches and established symbols.
