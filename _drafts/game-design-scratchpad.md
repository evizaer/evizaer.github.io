# Characteristics of randomness
    Directness or closeness of effect: Direct effect or close effect randomness means it's very close to the player's action and happens in the determination of an action's effect--perhaps their action's results are directly decided by dice, like a damage roll or a to-hit roll. Less direct randomness is caused by the player's action, but as a secondary effect, for instance when you refill the common cards in Ascension. Direct randomness in Ascension would be a card that gives you 1d2 runes to spend. The most indirect-effect randomness possible is some set-up randomness that happens before players make any decisions, and that can't favor the first player to play. Perhaps this is the equivalent of the input/output idea?

    Regularity of randomness is how reliable it is that randomness will be used to resolve something. If multiple mechanisms that the player uses to achieve the same goal exhibit different levels of randomness and perhaps some are deterministic, randomness is irregular. If the player can choose to do some things that are random or other things that are deterministic, randomness is irregular. If all randomness proceeds at predictable times that are a matter of regular procedure and are not the result of player actions, that random element is regular. Refilling the common card pool in Ascension is regular randomness, your choice of what to do with a character in XCOM on its turn is irregular randomness (movement is deterministic, some attacks are deterministic, some are random).

    Gamut is simply how big the effect of randomness is. You can think of this in terms of how many important discontinuities randomness can cross. Being able to remove actors with randomness is a big discontinuity that randomness straddles in most games. If you're just randomizing which piece you get next in tetris, that's relatively narrow-gamut (perhaps this is debatable). Narrow-gamut randomness is not terribly common--I think we'd typically just compare two random elements and say which has a wider gamut.

    Valuation-neutrality is how much random effects alter the value of a player's current position (in retrospect). More often I think the opposite is what we would discuss: just how Valuation-biasing randomness can be. I.e. does randomnses show a bias towards a certain strategy. So if in XCOM an alien shoots at you and randomly destroys your cover, that's very valuation-biasing. Even the map generation in Settlers of Catan is mildly valuation-biasing because it may screw players who go later. The only valuation-neutral randomness would happen before all player decisions are made, and the game would have to be simul-turns to prevent all first turn advantages derived from those random elements.
     

# Instead of arcs
I don't think [arcs] describes how to make actions throughout the game matter.
Here's how to make it happen: have the dynamics I listed above happen to the dimensions that players manipulate when they act. (feedback loops, resource exhaustion, compounding advantage, etc.)
So you have powerful actions having an impact over a period of time, but because of negative feedback loops, the game tends to return to a state of equilibrium (or something like that) and players need to convert that temporary advantage into some other dimension to actually win.
By dimension I mean resources in the most expanded sense. So that includes action cards, workers to place, whatever, as well as it does what we conventionally call resources
So you have natural undulations of player power level which cause something like arcs to form emergently
Players can't avoid these undulations because they are the costs of powerful actions.

State reset is one element of the concrete cluster of thoughts that stand in place of arcs in my mental model of how games work
Also: positive v. negative feedback loops and compounding advantage
all of these things tie together state changes in the more than immediate future.(edited)
resource accumulation/exhaustion is another one.
Hm. So the word I used to use to describe how the game is broken into seemingly discrete segments is "phasing"
But "phase" is just a label for a discrete segment of time that's divided from others by the nature of the streatgizing involved. It doesn't necessarily indicate some full cyclical thing
Phases have a fractal structure, but there's no such thing as a game-long phase. Phases exist in a kind of hierarchical relationship with one another.
Like in Agricola you have a worker placement phase which consists of individual players alternating specific placement phases. This fits into the phase of a single season, which fits into the generally phasing of when you have to feed your family.
Multiple phases at a lower level comprise single phases at the next higher level, which themselves combine to comprise higher level phases.
That's structural phasing you can assess based on rule analysis.
Then there's the phasing of play. Like early-, mid-, and late- game in chess.
Those aren't rule constructs, but recognizable segments of play that are identified because they each have a distinctive character, even though they eventually blend into one another as the phases change.
I don't use "phase" as a term a lot. I don't think it's the best word for the concept
It's just segmentation.

# leftover from analogy design methodology article

This is quite a powerful method of brainstorming. The designer can chain practical mechanical decisions into analogical justification into its implications to suggest further mechanical additions and begin the loop anew. They can start this process from just about any bit of their game design and suggest wide-ranging changes that are only limited by the imagination and originality of the designer. This is a useful design technique, but it requires you start somewhere.

Most designers start with a prototypical copying approach. Take structural properties of other games that you liked and copy them, filling in the various extension points they naturally offer with different details. By using an anological chaining technique as I demonstrated above, you can break free of the broad strokes your starting point gives you and move into uncharted ground.

One entry point into uncharted ground is addressing mechanical weaknesses of existing games. I'll be working on many different  tools for understanding how to form mechanically solid game systems. Using these techniques in combination with analogical chaining will lead to some pretty strange and unique results that none-the-less have solid-feeling game worlds that are as unique and deeply interconnected as the systems that give them substance. I'm hoping to arrive at an approach to game design that offers a whole-game approach where analogy feeds on mechanical strength which feeds on analogy.

## The Crucible

The true crucible of game design is the player actually playing the game. We now lack the tools to do much else but heavily rely on this crucible. Designing a game without extensive playtesting seems absurd these days. It shouldn't be, and by advancing the art we can change this. The typical process of the game designer is to recognize in a playtest that a player is engaged in behavior the designer doesn't want to encourage--perhaps simply being bored, or perhaps becoming aggressively hostile to all other players in what should be a cooperative game--then to try to make changes to the game rules to encourage a desired kind of behavior, or to make the negative behavior impossible or too costly for a rational player to pursue. The designer doesn't know if she's found success until the next playtest shows some change in player reaction. But player reaction itself is inconstant and sensitive to many influences outside the game. You don't want to start redesigning half your game because Dave's cat died earlier today and some mild prodding from Anne during his turn caused him to break down in tears. A bored player could be simply distracted by some personal issue. A player who seems enthralled and is working very hard to win may just be trying to impress a love interest and actually they're just happy to be near to someone they have a bit of a crush on. With our current limited understanding of game design in the abstract, designers can easily get trapped into poor design decisions because of the inexactitude of their own understanding of what success looks like, and the vicissitudes of their player's lives during one of a limited number of playtests.
# The stuff of design

"Stuff that is important to know about and you should be actively considering this stuff when you make any design decision" is maybe even better than guidelines, and I think you can do it well without making direct reference to existing games.
Because we don't have that stuff.
I think it's all intuited by individual designers based on their experience playing games and cataloguing what similar games feel like to play.(edited)
What I'm describing is really about nailing down the methodology of design, instead of focusing necessarily on what the results should look or feel like.(edited)
"Think about X and be able to consciously control it in each design decision"--then once you have that down you can start following guidelines because you actually have enough control to consciously follow the guidelines.

It's about positive/negative feedback loops, reward structure and player motivation, inherent complexity and cognitive load
calculation and heuristics
and all of the bits and pieces that feed into those higher level ways of conceptualizing how a game works

# The AAV Paradigm - Introduction

Strategy game design develops and balances three important aspects which are often at odds, but also can bolster one another when combined in certain ways.

## Agency

Without the player's actions having some meaning within the game, it's not worth playing the game.

## Analogy

Without the outside world to provide substantial meaning to the abstractions of a game, the game seems trivial.

## Variety

Without enough to try and do within a game, we'll quickly grow bored and move on.

# Hodological space
hodological space n. In the topological psychology of the Polish/German-born US psychologist Kurt Lewin (1890–1947), a special form of topological geometry in which paths and vectors are defined psychologically, the distance between one hodological region and another being not the shortest path but the path of least effort given the attractive and repulsive valences of the regions making up the space. See also principle of least effort.

# Agency (unused bits)

* Agency is in the player's mind
    * People default to thinking they have agency in whatever they participate in. Evolutionary biology of the mind, etc.
    * Seeing your actions have an impact is holistic. Interface juiciness matters.
    * When learning a game you have diminished agency because you don't have the groundwork for understanding what's happening.
    * Agency is all about the player forming causal chains from their actions to goals they want to achieve.
* Meaningful participation
    * You can locate yourself in causal chains.
* We can approximate agency
    * Compare player's input to effects in the game world tha the player can see.
    * COmpare directly observable effects of player input against what the rest of the system is doing.
    * It comes down to tracing causal chains.

A player's sense of Agency is easily fooled. Figuring out how much agency you have is a learned skill which people generally find mixed emotional results from honing.

People come to an understanding of their level of agency in a situation with exposure to games. Games with no agency involved, like betting on dice rolls, or Shoots and Ladders, entertain children and some adults if there's money on the line.

Since agency is in the player's mind, even simple and unsophisticated games like Tic-Tac-Toe permit agency for children and adults who are unfamiliar. Agency is about generating the feeling of meaningful participation in shaping a game's outcomes, thus the individual player's knowledge of the game always plays an important part. Game designers needs to take this into account and try to rapidly get the player accustomed to the game enough that they can see the at least some of the causal patterns that inform decision-making and let the player make sense of the results of their input.

Player action needs to matter within the system and be a central aspect.

Let's tease apart the elements of agency:

1. You can try to achieve your interests through manipulating some points of contact in the game system.
	1. You may have an avatar in the game world to represent you.
    1. The game system may permit unintermediated interaction, as in Starcraft.
1. The game relays some feedback to you regarding the impact of your actions that you can interpret as relevant to what you've done and your interests.
	1. The feedback needs to be significant enough that you can establish causal relationships.

So first we have to look at if an individual piece of input is validated by the output the game presents. This means tracing the player's expectations and checking them against the possible results in the game next time his input is needed. Not only does the game need to show mechanical effects of the player's input, showing "juicy" graphical cues can also be important. Not many players are going to tease apart the analogical from the mechanical here--providing an interface that feels good to use can amplify systemic agency, or fill in, to a limited extent, for where systemic agency is lacking.

Strategy games where the player commands simulated people doing things, like shooting aliens, use randomness to simulate the impact of the skill of the simulated people. Often this leads to scenarios where the player gives a command, but in the game world the associated action is only performed partially or not performed at all. For instance, in XCOM you tell a unit to attack, but the attack misses. The only way that you know the game isn't ignoring your input is that an animation plays and the unit's ammo is decremented for the weapon it fired. Here we have the interface reassuring the player that their input mattered, even though the result of that input was a non-event.

When we talk about agency in game design, we use it to describe the subjective experience of the player being able to project her will onto the game’s systems. This implies that games must present a system, and that games must allow the manipulation of the system in some way by some kind of player. If a game has a system but fails to present it in a way that a player can recognize, agency becomes impossible. Agency is a trait of the player's experience, not the game itself. Agency requires a chance for player input in the context of the system and feedback that reflects that input. The feedback doesn't have to be unambiguous and the input doesn't have to be unambiguous. Without a chance for input, you don't have any capacity for the player to act (or play) so agency becomes impossible; without feedback that reflects input there's no indication that the player has taken an action, so the causation-finding circuitry in the brain can't find purchase and the player doesn't get a sense that they are interacting. This is all trivial for real-world sports, because there's no artifice providing a view into the game system–the game system is a layer of pretense atop the physical universe, free of simulation.

We can look at agency in games as if we are having a conversation with the game. If you are talking to someone about elephants but they seem to respond regardless of your message with some mathematical equations about the shape of bananas, you wouldn't recognize that as a conversation. You are saying one thing, and independent of what you said, the other conversant said something else. You may be able to contrive a relationship, but it's far from obvious and intuitive. The person you're talking to may wait for a gap in your exposition to insert his irrelevant statements, which may convince you that your opposite is aiming for conversation, but that still leaves us entirely unsure you're having a conversation. In a game, you provide some input to the game and the game shows you a continuous stream of output. If the output doesn't seem relevant to your input, the connection between you and the game is not obviously there, and you are left with the impression that your input is ignored, much as a conversant spouting random facts at random intervals is, at best, questionably participating in a conversation. Establishing this feedback loop of relevance and reaction allows the player or conversant to build a causal model of the game or conversation in her mind that will map her actions to certain kinds of results based on observable contingencies. When Mary talked to Paul about politics, Paul got very agitated, so now Mary has this relationship between Paul, politics, and agitation in her mind. She’ll remember this the next time she tries to have a conversation with Paul and potentially use it to inform her communication with him. When you're playing Call of Duty and you click the left mouse button in the course of normal play your character's weapon appears to fire and the object your reticle is on seems to react visibly and audibly as if it were shot–now you can draw a causal relationship between that input and the effect on the game world.

Humans can be overwhelmed with contingencies and be rendered unable to draw any causal links. Humans can also draw causal links based on special cases that clearly are not representative, then, due to cognitive biases, ignore or disregard feedback that would show these highly-contingent causal links to be incorrect
