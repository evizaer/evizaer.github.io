# The stuff of design

"Stuff that is important to know about and you should be actively considering this stuff when you make any design decision" is maybe even better than guidelines, and I think you can do it well without making direct reference to existing games.
Because we don't have that stuff.
I think it's all intuited by individual designers based on their experience playing games and cataloguing what similar games feel like to play.(edited)
What I'm describing is really about nailing down the methodology of design, instead of focusing necessarily on what the results should look or feel like.(edited)
"Think about X and be able to consciously control it in each design decision"--then once you have that down you can start following guidelines because you actually have enough control to consciously follow the guidelines.

It's about positive/negative feedback loops, reward structure and player motivation, inherent complexity and cognitive load
calculation and heuristics
and all of the bits and pieces that feed into those higher level ways of conceptualizing how a game works

# The AAV Paradigm - Introduction

Strategy game design develops and balances three important aspects which are often at odds, but also can bolster one another when combined in certain ways.

## Agency

Without the player's actions having some meaning, it's not worth playing the game.

## Analogy

Without the outside world to provide substantial meaning to the abstractions of a game, the game seems trivial.

## Variety

Without enough to try and do within a game, we'll quickly grow bored and move on.
