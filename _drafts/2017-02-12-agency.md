## Agency

Player action needs to matter within the system and be a central aspect.

Let's tease apart the elements of agency:

1. You can try to achieve your interests through manipulating some points of contact in the game system.
	1. You may have an avatar in the game world to represent you.
    1. The game system may permit unintermediated interaction, as in Starcraft.
1. The game relays some feedback to you regarding the impact of your actions that you can interpret as relevant to what you've done and your interests.
	1. The feedback needs to be significant enough that you can establish causal relationships.

So first we have to look at if an individual piece of input is validated by the output the game presents. This means tracing the player's expectations and checking them against the possible results in the game next time his input is needed.

If there's a simulation aspect to the game your input may clearly to perform an action, but in the game world the action is only performed partially or not performed at all. For instance, in XCOM you tell a unit to attack, but the attack misses. The only way that you know the game isn't ignoring your input is that an animation plays and the unit's ammo is decremented for the weapon it fired.

When we talk about agency in game design, we use it to describe the subjective experience of the player being able to project her will onto the game’s systems. This implies that games must present a system, and that games must allow the manipulation of the system in some way by some kind of player. If a game has a system but fails to present it in a way that a player can recognize, agency becomes impossible. Agency is a trait of the player's experience, not the game itself. Agency requires a chance for player input in the context of the system and feedback that reflects that input. The feedback doesn't have to be unambiguous and the input doesn't have to be unambiguous. Without a chance for input, you don't have any capacity for the player to act (or play) so agency becomes impossible; without feedback that reflects input there's no indication that the player has taken an action, so the causation-finding circuitry in the brain can't find purchase and the player doesn't get a sense that they are interacting. This is all trivial for real-world sports, because there's no artifice providing a view into the game system–the game system is a layer of pretense atop the physical universe, free of simulation.

We can look at agency in games as if we are having a conversation with the game. If you are talking to someone about elephants but they seem to respond regardless of your message with some mathematical equations about the shape of bananas, you wouldn't recognize that as a conversation. You are saying one thing, and independent of what you said, the other conversant said something else. You may be able to contrive a relationship, but it's far from obvious and intuitive. The person you're talking to may wait for a gap in your exposition to insert his irrelevant statements, which may convince you that your opposite is aiming for conversation, but that still leaves us entirely unsure you're having a conversation. In a game, you provide some input to the game and the game shows you a continuous stream of output. If the output doesn't seem relevant to your input, the connection between you and the game is not obviously there, and you are left with the impression that your input is ignored, much as a conversant spouting random facts at random intervals is, at best, questionably participating in a conversation. Establishing this feedback loop of relevance and reaction allows the player or conversant to build a causal model of the game or conversation in her mind that will map her actions to certain kinds of results based on observable contingencies. When Mary talked to Paul about politics, Paul got very agitated, so now Mary has this relationship between Paul, politics, and agitation in her mind. She’ll remember this the next time she tries to have a conversation with Paul and potentially use it to inform her communication with him. When you're playing Call of Duty and you click the left mouse button in the course of normal play your character's weapon appears to fire and the object your reticle is on seems to react visibly and audibly as if it were shot–now you can draw a causal relationship between that input and the effect on the game world.

Humans can be overwhelmed with contingencies and be rendered unable to draw any causal links. Humans can also draw causal links based on special cases that clearly are not representative, then, due to cognitive biases, ignore or disregard feedback that would show these highly-contingent causal links to be incorrect
