## Analogy and the process of design.

Although I write about the design of games and have a love of seeing the mechanics stripped of their potentially-obfuscating metaphorical components, I must recognize that the way most games are designed is a process that starts with the analogy and works its way to the mechanics. Designers pick what kind of a game they want to make through reference to genre convention and personal experience. Design decisions are informed by some interesting interaction in the real world that the designer wants to model.

Game designers do not make analogical design decisions independently of the abstractions they are designing. Just as the players use a game’s analogies to relate to the game’s abstractions, the designer uses analogies as proxy concepts to more easily grasp the logical relationships that should exist between game pieces.
